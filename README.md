Learn to read and write process memory into csgo the proper way
New offsets can be found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frk1/hazedumper/master/csgo.hpp

What can you do to make this better?

-Create a template for Reading and Writing. Makes writing to custom structs easier and work faster

-Create a Player class so that in your feature methods you don't need read and writing everywhere. EX: Player.Health, Player.SetSpotted
